I’ve decided to implement the Caesar Cipher using C#, which was used by the Roman Empire to encode military secrets.

To use the cipher, draw the alphabet in a circle like so:

Alphabet with letters arranged in a circle
Take every letter of your message and shift it three places to the right. For example, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and “attack” becomes “dwwdfn”.
